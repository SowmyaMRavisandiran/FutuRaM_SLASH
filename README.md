# FutuRaM_SLASH
Repository that contains code, and data for input parameters that contain the stock and flow (SF) model for biomass ash and sewage sludge ash, and the code to combine stock and flow data, composition data, and recovery TC data for all slags and ashes waste streams of FutRaM project

**fao.ipynb**: stock and flow model for biomass ash (with input data under data folder)

**sewage_slidge.ipynb**: stock and flow model for sewage sludge (with input data under sewage_sludge folder)

**plug-in code and data/element_flows_full_format.py**: model to combine SF data and composition data (plug-in code and data/input_data/240419_consolidation_dataset_template_flow-deposit_WP3_version3_SLASH_v4(SLASH_consolidated_inputForSF.csv)

**plug-in code and data/tc_multiplication.py**: Recovery model to multiply SF+ composition data with Recovery Transfer coefficients data (plug-in code and data/input_data/Transfer coefficients_SLASH.xlsx)
